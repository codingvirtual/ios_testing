# ios_testing
A shared/group project dedicated to creating a simplistic iOS app and building example XCTestCase classes and code to show how to test the app.

This project is beginning as a response to multiple Udacity students (myself included) desiring to learn more about Test Driven Development and specifically testing iOS code. The goal is to come up with a simple "representative" app for iOS and a set of example test cases that demonstrate how to build tests of various iOS elements including the App Delegate, network/asynchronous calls, etc.
